# User documentation

End-user documentation is available in `docs` folder, to compile in HTML run:

```
sphinx-build docs/ sphinx-build
```

# Requirements

 - Connection to source and destination clouds through external (public) 
   network from host with CloudFerry.
 - Valid private ssh-key for both clouds which will be using by CloudFerry for
   data transferring.
 - Admin keystone access (typically admin access point lives on 35357 port).
 - sudo/root access on compute and controller nodes.
 - Openstack MySQL DB write access.
 - Credentials of global cloud admin for both clouds.
 - All the Python requirements are listed in requirements.txt.


# Installation

CloudFerry can be installed as docker container or it can be installed as a
python package by pip.

## Installation with pip

1. Make sure you have non-python packages installed in your system
(following for Ubuntu):
    ```
    sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev \
        libxslt1-dev python-pip python-dev git -y
    ```

2. Install virtualenv version 15.0.3
    ```
    sudo pip install virtualenv==15.0.3
    ```

3. Install cloudferry with pip:
    ```
    virtualenv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install git+git://github.com/Mirantis/CloudFerry.git
    ```

## Installation with docker

### Building the docker container
```
docker build --build-arg cf_commit_or_branch=origin/master -t <username>/cf-in-docker .
```

### Start container
```
docker run -it <username>/cf-in-docker
```

### Saving and loading the container files
```
docker save --output=/path/to/save/CloudFerry.img <username>/cf-in-docker
docker load --input=/path/to/save/CloudFerry.img
```

# Usage

## Overview

CloudFerry tool is used by running python `cloudferry` executable from the 
command line.

All available commands can be viewed with:
```
# see list of available commands
cloudferry list
```

## Configuration

Sample config can be generated with
```
oslo-config-generator --namespace cloudferry
```

Configuration process is quite complex and mostly manual try-and-see-if-works
process.

## Whole cloud migration

Make sure you have `migrate_whole_cloud` option in `migrate` section of config
is set to `True`.

Use `migrate` command with config file specified:

```
cloudferry migrate <config file>
```

## Migrating specific instances

In order to migrate specific VMs, one should use filters. This is done through
modifying filters file (`configs/filter.yaml` by default).

Edit `configs/filter.yaml`:

```
instances:
    id:
        - 7c53a6ab-0149-4232-80b3-b2d7ce02995a
        - f0fea76a-0a7d-4c25-ab9e-f048dbc7365d
```

Run migration as usual:
```
cloudferry migrate configuration.ini --debug
```

## Playground

See QUICKSTART.md for the quickest way of running your first successful migration.
